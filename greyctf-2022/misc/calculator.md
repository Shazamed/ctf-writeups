>Calculator is a nice invention

Connecting to the remote server gives us the following:
```How fast are you on calculating basic math expression?
Answer 100 math questions in 30 seconds to the flag

Operations include: 
1. add x y -> returns x + y
2. mul x y -> returns x * y
3. sub x y -> returns x - y
4. neg x -> returns -x
5. inc x -> returns x + 1

Example1: mul add 1 2 sub 5 1
Ans1: (1 + 2) * (5 - 1) = 12

Example2: add mul sub 3 2 inc 5 3
Ans2: (3 - 2) * (5 + 1) + 3 = 9
```

This indicates that will be using a prefix notation to calculate the equations.

While there are prefix calculators code out on stackoverflow I've opted to challenge myself to write the algorithmn from scratch.

TODO zzzz
